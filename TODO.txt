~~|TO DO|~~

Current Goals:
* Misc. changes so the repository can work correctly for the most part with InmortalKaktus' Pokémon Editor.
* Update Learnsets to Gen. 4 (Pt/HG/SS) standards.

Long-term Goals:
* Fix Charge Beam's effect and stats. It is temporarily boosted to 100 Power Points due to its effect being missing.
* Make an animation for Wood Hammer and the other moves that come afterwards.
* Implement formes for the pokémon that are supposed to have one (Burmy, Cherrim, Rotom, Giratina, Shaymin, Arceus).
* Make it so Judgment checks for an item (the plates) and changes its type depending on which one Arceus is holding at that time.
* Try to create new abilities and implement all the ones added in the Gen. 4 games, or at least most of them.
* Look into creating new move effects to add the moves that are missing in [the LEARNSETS STATUS document](https://github.com/LOuroboros/pokeruby493/blob/master/LEARNSETS%20STATUS.txt).

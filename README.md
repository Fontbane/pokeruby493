I'll be uploading sheets consisting of 4 pictures for each pokémon I add to this base. All the pictures can be found inside [the screenshots folder](screenshots).

### Bugs
As of right now, there aren't any bugs. There's a small issue involving pokémon not showing up in the pokédex using existing savefiles, but in those cases you just need to catch the pokémon again and they'll show up correctly.

### Other Features

I intend to implement as many Gen. 4 features as I can to this base. Right now, the other features aside from the expanded amount of pokémon are:

* Held items effect boosted from 10% to 20%

* You can now run indoors

* There's 7 Gen. 4 moves added, which are Aqua Jet, Double Hit, Nasty Plot, Night Slash, Dark Pulse, Sucker Punch and Feint.

* There's 2 new evolution stones, the Shiny Stone for Roselia and the Dusk Stone for Misdreavus and Murkrow.

* The Oval Stone was added too as Happiny requires it to evolve into Chansey.

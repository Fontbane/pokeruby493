### Description
Attempt at making a public base of Pokeruby with expanded pokémon up to Arceus and other Gen. 4 features.

I'll be uploading sheets consisting of 4 pictures for each pokémon I add to this base. All the pictures can be found inside [the screenshots folder](screenshots).

### Bugs
As of right now, there aren't any bugs. There's a small issue involving pokémon not showing up in the pokédex using existing savefiles, but in those cases you just need to catch the pokémon again and they'll show up correctly.

### Other Features

I intend to implement as many Gen. 4 features as I can to this base. Right now, the other features aside from the expanded amount of pokémon are:

* Held items effect boosted from 10% to 20%

* You can now run indoors

* There's 40 Gen. 4 moves added, which are Aqua Jet, Double Hit, Nasty Plot, Night Slash, Dark Pulse, Sucker Punch, Feint, Ominous Wind, Shadow Sneak, Dragon Rush, Fire Fang, Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, Aura Sphere, Close Combat (although its effect isn't implemented yet), Dragon Pulse, Force Palm, Mud Bomb, Poison Jab, Power Whip, Brave Bird, Flare Blitz, Zen Headbutt, Ice Shard, Brine, Aqua Tail, Air Slash, Bug Buzz, Vacuum Wave, X-Scissor, Bullet Punch, Iron Head, Wood Hammer, Magnet Bomb, Discharge, Mirror Shot, Rock Wrecker, Stone Edge, Giga Impact, Lava Plume, Psycho Cut, Power Gem, Earth Power, Flash Cannon, Roar of Time, Spacial Rend, Magma Storm, Shadow Force and Shadow Claw (the last 17 currently use Pound's animation as a placeholder).

* There's 2 new evolution stones, the Shiny Stone for Roselia and Togetic, and the Dusk Stone for Misdreavus and Murkrow.

* The following evolution-inducing items were added: Oval Stone, Protector, Electirizer, Magmarizer, Razor Claw, Razor Fang, Dubious Disc, Reaper Cloth.

* New evolution methods have been implemented to account for the evolutions of certain pokémon like Combee, Happiny, Aipom, Sneasel, Gligar, Nosepass, Magneton, Mantyke, etc.

* Gen. 4 trade evolutions will use my own custom evolution method by default, where pokémon like Electabuzz or Magmar evolve starting at Lv52 while holding their evolutionary item (Electirizer and Magmarizer respectively, in this case).

* Poisoning in the overworld works just like it does in the Gen. 4 Games.

* The Light Ball works just like in the Gen. 4 Games. It doubles not only Pikachu's Sp. Atk, but its Atk too.

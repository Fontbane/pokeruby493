### Description
Attempt at making a public base of Pokeruby with expanded pokémon up to Arceus and other Gen. 4 features.

I don't know when or if I'll ever be able to complete it, so keep that in mind.

### Progress
493/493 - 386 + All the Gen. 4 Pokémon. This project doesn't include alternate formes for now, however.

There's picture sheets for all the Gen. 4 Pokémon in [the screenshots folder](screenshots). Opinions about the placement of the different sprites in battle are welcomed.

### Bugs

* Arceus' sprite doesn't change when holding one of the 16 stone plates.

* The Life Orb hurts the user even if they used a status move.

* Judgment's effect and Roost's secondary effect aren't implemented yet.

### Other Features

I intend to implement as many Gen. 4 features as I can to this base. Right now, the other features aside from the expanded amount of pokémon are:

* Held items effect boosted from 10% to 20%-

* You can now run indoors-

* Several Gen. 4 moves were added. The list starts with Aqua Jet in [the moves.h file](https://github.com/LOuroboros/pokeruby493/blob/fa8a7c4745c3687a703dea9c7d2cd23b2c7244a0/include/constants/moves.h#L359).

* There's 2 new evolution stones: The Shiny Stone for Roselia and Togetic, and the Dusk Stone for Misdreavus and Murkrow.

* The following evolution-inducing items were added: Oval Stone, Protector, Electirizer, Magmarizer, Razor Claw, Razor Fang, Dubious Disc, Reaper Cloth.

* New evolution methods have been implemented to account for the evolutions of certain pokémon like Combee, Happiny, Aipom, Sneasel, Gligar, Nosepass, Magneton, Mantyke, etc.

* Gen. 4 trade evolutions will use my own custom evolution method by default, where pokémon like Electabuzz or Magmar evolve starting at Lv52 while holding their evolutionary item (Electirizer and Magmarizer respectively, in this case).

* Poisoning in the overworld works just like it does in the Gen. 4 Games.

* The Light Ball works just like in the Gen. 4 Games. It doubles not only Pikachu's Sp. Atk, but its Atk too.

* Physical/Special/Status Split [thanks to Sewef](https://github.com/Sewef/pokeruby/commit/28b9b9f7e05f4f3bb13e526b50f33a5b8aa90020).
